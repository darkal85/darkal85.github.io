abstract="On the basis of the well known pumping lemma for regular languages we define such a partial function f:                                                                           {\$}{\{}{\backslash}mbox{\{}I{\backslash}!N{\}}{\}} {\backslash}rightarrow{\{}{\backslash}mbox{\{}I{\backslash}!N{\}}{\}}{\$}                 that for every e it yields the least pumping constant for the language W                                  e                . We ask whether f is computable. Not surprisingly f turns out to be non-computable. Then we check whether f is algorithmically learnable. This is also proved not to be the case. Further we investigate how powerful oracle is necessary to actually learn f. We prove that f is learnable in 0{\textasciiacutex}. We also prove some facts relating f to arithmetical hierarchy.",
