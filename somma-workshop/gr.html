<b>Experiments in social meaning and information structure

<div class="tab">In linguistic interactions humans do more than share propositions and convey semantic meaning; they also structure their contributions to foreground, background, and emphasise different components of what they want to convey, and they convey social meanings in the form, rather than the content, of their utterances. Understanding these processes requires, among other things, observing the process of meaning making in interaction. While, on the one hand, that means observing meaning in the wild outside the lab, interaction can happen inside the lab as well. Laboratory communication games afford opportunities to strip away the baggage of participantsâ€™ native languages and reveal patterns that would otherwise be hard to see. In this talk I present several such experiments in which we were able to observe emergence and change in meaning, with a focus on social meaning and information structure.</div>
