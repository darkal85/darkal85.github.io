<b>From constraining by signs to constraining by relations:
Dynamical analysis of semiotic process in development
</b>

<br>

<div class="tab">The necessity of both signs and dynamics in describing informational processes in living
systems have been advocated at least since the 60s of the last century (Polanyi, 1968;
Pattee, 1969). A useful conceptualization of their relation seems to be that of control, where
informational structures are understood as functional constraints on relevant degrees of
freedom on various time-scales (Pattee, 1973; Rączaszek-Leonardi &amp; Kelso, 2008). This move
liberates theories of communication, including language, from the cumbersome „coding
metaphor”, which hinders at least some aspects of constructing a viable semantic theory
(Brette, in press).
</div>

<div class="tab">The same move, however, calls for new frameworks for capturing the informational
processes and in my talk I will propose that such a framework may consist in integrating
dynamical systems analysis with the semiotic approach (Rączaszek-Leonardi et al., 2018).
Semiotic approach helps dynamical systems theory recognize various types of constraints,
while dynamical systems approach brings useful operationalization of the key notion of
“interpretation”, which to many may seem esoteric and to some overly internalist.</div>

<div class="tab">This theoretical background allows for rethinking the symbol emergence process: rather
than “simply” seeking symbol grounding (often in the form of mapping) it forces a
researcher to recognize a complex semiotic infrastructure on which symbolic control of
dynamical processes constitutively depends (Deacon, 1997; 2011). Useful reformulations of
the aspects of abstractness and compositionality follow. In my talk I will focus on the relation
between the complexity of control and compositionality in mother-infant interactions in
development and show how empirical research on interactions over the ontogenetic time
scale may inform computational models of the general principles of symbol emergence.</div>
