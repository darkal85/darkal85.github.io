<b>Linguistic politeness as strategic behavior: (some) costs and benefits of polite language use

Behavioral ecology explains the behavior of animals by treating them as rational agents driven by a maximisation of their benefit-cost differentials. On the uncontroversial assumptions that humans are animals, and that speaking is a type of behavior, this overall approach should - at least in principle - generalise to language use: it should be possible to understand speakers as “rational decision-makers who make tradeoffs between costs and benefits”. Despite the obvious difficulties involved in determining both the relevant types behavior (language use) and the relevant costs and benefits, there has been some success in applying this reasoning to “pockets” of linguistic behavior such as indirect speech (Pinker, Nowak & Lee 2006) or politeness (Quinley 2012). Most recently, the Responsibility Exchange Theory (RET; Chaudhry and Loewenstein 2019) effectively provides a proof of concept of this general approach for a narrow class of dyadic interactions (assignment of responsibility for a positive/negative outcome): it establishes functional classes of linguistic behavior (apologising, thanking) and works out a compelling theory of the associated social costs/benefits.</div>

<div class="tab">In my talk, I build on the conceptual foundation proposed by Chaudhry and Loewenstein (2019) and look into ways of extending their approach; in particular:
</div>
<div class="tab">&#9679;&nbsp;how the constructs of Competence and Warmth provide the tools to address the central problem that Linguistic Politeness (LP) faces from a utility-based perspective: why LP is valuable and not “cheap talk”;</div>
    <div class="tab">&#9679;&nbsp;how Competence and Warmth, social-psychological constructs, could be further "naturalised" with reference to the notions of prestige and reciprocity, which would make it possible to connect this approach to the literature on the evolution of cooperation, and in particular on indirect reciprocity.</div>
