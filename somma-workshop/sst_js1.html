<b>Explaining Semantic Universals, I: Learnability
</b>

<div class="tab">The languages of the world vary greatly, but within systematic limits that linguists have been uncovering for decades.  Our research has been developing a unified explanation of semantic universals: properties of meaning shared by all natural languages.  In this first talk, we will explain and defend our main hypothesis: such universals arise because expressions satisfying them are <i>easier to learn</i> than those that do not.  We provide evidence for this hypothesis via computational experiments in three very different linguistic domains: quantifiers, responsive predicates, and color terms.
