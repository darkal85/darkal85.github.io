<b>Logical foundations of social influence & social networks

<div class="tab">We give an introduction to the use of logical tools in
understanding social influence and social networks phenomena.
Individuals often form their opinions by interpreting the behavior of
others around them, and by reasoning about how those others have
formed their opinions. This leads to several well-known herd
phenomena, such as informational cascades, bystander effect,
pluralistic ignorance, bubbles, and polarization. For instance, in the
case of informational cascades, agents in a sequence imitate each
other's choices despite having diverging private evidence, sometimes
leading the whole community to make the worst possible choice. Similar
cascading mechanisms are at the heart of social networks diffusion
phenomena.
</div>
<div class="tab">We first show how an epistemic logic modeling allows to understand the
conditions for such cascades to form, as well as their inescapability.
We then turn to what logical tools can do for understanding
information flow and influence in social networks. We illustrate how
extremely simplified models might yield surprising new results, for
instance about stabilization conditions of diffusion processes.
