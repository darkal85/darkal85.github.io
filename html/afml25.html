	abstract = {We investigate the degree spectra of computable relations on canonically ordered natural numbers \$\$({\textbackslash}omega ,{\textless})\$\$and integers \$\$({\textbackslash}zeta ,{\textless})\$\$. As for \$\$({\textbackslash}omega ,{\textless})\$\$, we provide several criteria that fix the degree spectrum of a computable relation to all c.e. or to all \$\${\textbackslash}Delta \_2\$\$degrees; this includes the complete characterization of the degree spectra of so-called computable block functions that have only finitely many types of blocks. Compared to Bazhenov et al. (in: LIPIcs, vol 219, pp 8:1–8:20, 2022), we obtain a more general solution to the problem regarding possible degree spectra on \$\$({\textbackslash}omega ,{\textless})\$\$, answering the question whether there are infinitely many such spectra. As for \$\$({\textbackslash}zeta ,{\textless})\$\$, we prove the following dichotomy result: given an arbitrary computable relation R on \$\$({\textbackslash}zeta ,{\textless})\$\$, its degree spectrum is either trivial or it contains all c.e. degrees. This result, and the proof techniques required to solve it, extend the analogous theorem for \$\$({\textbackslash}omega ,{\textless})\$\$obtained by Wright (Computability 7:349–365, 2018), and provide initial insight to Wright’s question whether such a dichotomy holds on computable ill-founded linear orders. This article is an extended version of Bazhenov et al. (in: LIPIcs, vol 219, pp 8:1–8:20, 2022).},
